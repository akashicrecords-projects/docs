AkcSwap User Manual

1\. Introduction

AkcSwap is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) that allows users to complete token transactions without using a centralized exchange.

2\. Overview

This document provides detailed descriptions of liquidity and trading to help users understand how to operate on the AkcSwap platform.

3\. Liquidity

3\.1 LP Tokens
For example, if you deposit AKC and ETH.ETH into a liquidity pool, you will receive AKC-ETH.ETH LP tokens.
The number of LP tokens you receive represents your share of the AKC-ETH.ETH liquidity pool.
You can redeem your funds at any time by removing liquidity.

3\.2 Earn Trading Fees
Whenever someone trades on AkcSwap, the trader pays a 0.25% fee, of which 0.17% is added to the liquidity pool of the corresponding trading pair.

3\.3 Add/Remove Liquidity
"Liquidity" is at the core of AkcSwap's decentralized exchange operations.
You can add liquidity for any token pair on the liquidity page. As a reward for providing liquidity, you will earn trading fees for that pair and receive LP tokens.

3\.3.1 Adding Liquidity
Example: Adding liquidity for AKC and ETH.ETH on Akashic Chain's AkcSwap.

1. Visit the Liquidity page.
1. Click the “Add Liquidity” button to open the token pair selection prompt.
1. In the token pair selection fields, choose the two tokens you wish to add liquidity for. For example, choose ETH.ETH on the top and AKC on the bottom.
1. In one of the input fields under “Enter Amount”, input an amount for one token. The other token amount will be automatically calculated and filled. If you don’t have enough balance for one of the tokens, the button will appear grayed out. Enter a smaller amount or use the “Max” button to automatically fill in the maximum available amount.
1. Click “Approve ETH.ETH”. If the pair you’re adding liquidity for includes a token other than ETH.ETH, you may need to click Approve twice, once for each token. Confirm the authorization operation in your wallet.
1. The “Supply” button will now be enabled. Click it to proceed.
1. Your wallet will prompt you for confirmation. Confirm the on-chain operation in your wallet.
1. You can now view your LP token balance on the liquidity page.

3\.3.2 Removing Liquidity
Follow these steps to remove liquidity:

1. Visit the Liquidity page.
1. Under “Your Liquidity”, click the token pair you wish to remove. Use the filter feature to quickly find your liquidity positions.
1. Click “Remove” to open a new page.
1. Use the slider or buttons to select how much liquidity you want to remove. Click “Max” to remove all liquidity for the selected pair.
1. Click “Enable”, and confirm the operation in your wallet.
1. The “Remove” button will now be enabled. Click it to proceed.
1. A pop-up will display the amount of tokens you will receive. Click “Confirm”, and then confirm the operation in your wallet.
1. Once the transaction is confirmed on-chain, you will receive both tokens from the pair. If you didn’t remove all liquidity, the remaining liquidity value will be updated on the “Liquidity” page.

4\. Trading

4\.1 Swapping
Swapping tokens on AkcSwap is a straightforward method of token trading. It uses automated liquidity pools and currently supports the BNB Smart Chain, Ethereum, and Akashic Chain. You can also trade directly with Market Makers.

When trading tokens on Akashic Chain's AkcSwap, you will pay a transaction fee based on the type of liquidity pool used for your trade.

For the liquidity pools in the trading system, you will pay a fixed transaction fee of 0.25%, which is allocated as follows:

- 0.17%: Returned to liquidity providers. This is injected into the liquidity pool as trading fee rewards and is realized when liquidity is withdrawn.
- 0.0225%: Allocated to the AkcSwap team treasury.
- 0.0575%: Used for AKC buybacks and burns.

4\.2 Token Trading

1. Connect your wallet by clicking Connect Wallet in the upper-right corner.
1. Use the dropdown menu beside the token field to select the token you wish to trade. The default token is BNB. Ensure you have some tokens in your wallet for the trade. Your wallet’s balance for the selected token is displayed to the right of the dropdown menu.
